# About
This project is a high-fidelity prototype I made for my class project in CS 3041: human-Computer Interaction. It is not intended to be fully functional or to be programmed in the best way possible. Rather, it is designed to give a test user a sense of what a final website would be able to do and how a user would go through the tasks available on the site.

# How to Use the Prototype
Clone this repository to your personal computer. You can then open any of the HTML files in your web browser and navigate the site from there using the navbar up top.  
If you want to use your own images for testing the forum page, download them to the `images` directory. The JavaScript functions to load images into the page work only with the `images` directory, so images stored anywhere else will not work.
