# About
This project is a high-fidelity prototype I made for my class project in CS 3041: human-Computer Interaction. It is not intended to be fully functional or to be programmed in the best way possible. Rather, it is designed to give a test user a sense of what a final website would be able to do and how a user would go through the tasks available on the site.
